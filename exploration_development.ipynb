        "2. `df = pd.read_csv('iris.csv')`: The `read_csv` function is used to read a CSV (comma-separated values) file and convert it into a DataFrame. In this case, the CSV file 'iris.csv' is loaded into a DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame is stored in the variable `df`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `df`: This line is just calling the variable `df` which is your DataFrame. If this script is run in a Python interpreter or Jupyter notebook, it will print the DataFrame to the console. Depending on the environment, it might show the whole DataFrame or just the first few and last few rows if the DataFrame is large."
